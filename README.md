# Rancid Tomatillos
Rancid Tomatillos is a modern day movie review application, that lists popular titles and allows users to view their average ratings. Users can view details for each movie, and when logged in they can submit and see their own ratings in addition to the average ratings of all users.

This was a Mod 3 project in Turing School of Software and Design's Front End Engineering program during the 2008 inning. This project was designed to help students better understand how to:
- Build an application with a React architecture
- Use React Router to create a multi-page user experience
- Test component and asynchronous functionality with the React Testing Library
- Understand CRUD requests with a shared, persistent, third-party API
- Practice a professional GitHub workflow

## Setup/Installation
- Clone down the repo using `git clone git@github.com:Abdeboskey/rancid-tomatillos.git`
- Run `npm install` in the root of the newly created directory to install the necessary dependencies
- Running `npm start` in your terminal should launch the application in your browser. If not, navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` to view the application in action
- If you'd like to log in as a user, you can do so with the username `Tinsel@turing.io` and password `zxcvb`

## App in Action

## Wins/Challenges
#### Wins
- Built a functional application with a new framework in less than two weeks
- Successfully implemented React Router in a single day
- Successfully solidified understanding of the asynchronous fetch function

#### Challenges
- Creating a full-coverage testing suite with a new testing library required us to research some rather obtuse documentation
- Managing the work load of the Turing program in the midst of a very consuming project and the continued global pandemic
- Figuring out how to efficiently navigate paired programming despite persistent technical/connection issues
