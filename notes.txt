UI Elements the we need to wireframe -

---> Homepage view of the App

-----> Header (Navbar) with Title, and button to Login 
-------> On login the User's name is displayed on navbar and button changes to Logout

-----> Main section with card layout for all available movies
-------> Movie cards are potentially laid out on strips of film.
-------> Each card has a Piccy-pic with a title and rating below.

---> Detail view for a movie card:

------> Movie poster from main view exists in top left corner
------> Title is centered across the top
------> Rating lives below the title
------> Details/info section exists below rating (on Clapboard Blank)
------> Background image is the alternate image from API (possibly opaque or blurred for clarity)
------> Videos will exist in a video section below the info-clapboard?
--------> When videos are played, they pop up as a centered overlay?
